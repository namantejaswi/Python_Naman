# Implementing BFS

# The fundamental idea is to start with a arbitrary node and visit all the nodes connected to it.
# Then we move to the next node and visit all the nodes connected to it.

#In order to carry out this procedure we use the qeueue data structure.

# We start with any vertex, enqeue and then start visiting the connected vertices.
# Any connected vertex we encounter, if it is not in the qeue we enqueue it.
# Once all the elments of the neighbours of a vertex are visited, we dequeue it.
# Then we move on to the next vertex present in queue and repeat the process.
